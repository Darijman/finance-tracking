## ðŸ“’ Process

### Finance Notes:
Core feature allowing users to add, update, delete, and fetch income or expense records.

### Finance Categories:
Users can create up to 10 custom categories to better organize their financial data.

### Currencies:
Users can set and update their preferred currency. All data is formatted accordingly. (Default: USD $).

### Fixtures:
Used to populate the database with initial or test data for faster development and testing.

### Multer:
Integrated for handling file uploads. Only for basic categories so far.

### Redis:
Used for performance optimization.

### Guards:
Implemented custom **AuthGuard** and **OwnerOrAdminGuard** to secure routes and enforce role-based access. Also added Guards for specific entities to avoid code duplication.

### Roles:
Admin/user roles are supported with specific permissions.

### Users:
Authenticated user management, including profile and currency preferences.

### NOTE: The project's purpose

- Gain deeper experience with MySQL and explore how Redis can improve API performance.
- Leverage Redis for efficient caching and data handling.
- Design a better user interface using a sidebar layout instead of a traditional header.
- Deepen understanding of JWT tokens and cookies for secure authentication.
- Implement robust route protection using decorators like @Admin(), @Public(), @UseGuards(), and more.
- Improve error handling to provide a smoother and more user-friendly UI experience.

## ðŸ’¡ INSPIRATION

- I drew inspiration from the desktop version of Instagram, which is why my sidebar design looks quite similar to theirs.
